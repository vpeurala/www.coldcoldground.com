Cold Cold Ground has been working under this name since the start of year 2004, although the seeds of the band were sown by Hauptmann D many years earlier. Our purpose is to make gritty, noisy and disturbing rock music with an industrial flavor. Listen to our second EP "Custom Built" on the music page.
