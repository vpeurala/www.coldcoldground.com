<h1>Cold Cold Ground - a Band and a Spectacle</h1>
<p>
Cold can be hot. Evil can be good.
</p>
<p>
Cold Cold Ground, coming from Helsinki, Finland, is a vibrant band with purifying anger and subliminal sexual energy, with such power that it has been heard over the seas. American promotion agency <b>Mama Trash</b> signed Cold Cold Ground in November 2008. Due to this co-operation CCG has increased visibility among new audiences.
</p>
<p>
In this promo kit you will find three demo songs from CCG's upcoming album. The package also includes two music videos. The audience voted our first music video 'Warden' to the top ten in Voice TV's Garage Countdown contest in 2008. New promo pictures reveal the dark but dazzling visual style of each CCG member (photos by Mr. Okko Oinonen). CCG's high quality package is now ready for exporting.
</p>
<p>
At the moment <b>Cold Cold Ground is looking for a record label</b>. The songs for the debut album are composed and rehearsed. The legendary primus motor of <b>Waltari</b>, Mr. <b>K&auml;rtsy Hatakka</b>, is going to produce CCG's debut album. Demo recordings will take place soon and the actual recordings will start in September 2009.
</p>
<p>
Make your move and fight against the depression like hell. This is a rare opportunity for Your Company to work with one of the most promising and complete bands.
</p>
<p>
The band is also looking for concert booking agencies. CCG is ready for the road - please, come and check when we prove that on our next gig! You can contact us via means listed below. Thank you for your time.
