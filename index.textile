h3. Cold Cold Ground has a new drummer

H.Dine, who played drums at the Gloria show last Friday, has now officially become a member of Cold Cold Ground. He brings a tremendous amount of energy and new ideas to the table, not to mention his monstrously hard and tight drumming. Check him out at Semifinal on the 4th of December! 

Sadly, this also means that Monsieur Beau is no longer in the band. Hauptmann D, Mr. Bunny and NooZ want to thank Beau for being a friend and a bandmate for the past three years. They also wish him the best of luck with whatever he decides to do in the future.
